To organize your own bid team, please contact via proxy information below. If you submit your property bid to bidkitty, we will use our funds and ticket to purchase this property on your behalf. The bid request form will ask you for your max bid price. 
<p>In 2014, Wayne County increased the cost of participation in the annual land auction by 300% (now $2000) despite the fact that many properties went unsold in 2013 with a minimum bid of $500.
After auction players have stacked their chips, those without the buy in ticket funds are left to watch their neighborhood sell off to the highest bidder. Even community efforts to fundraise toward the "multi-bid" ticket have been marginalized by the creation of the $25K property bundles.<p>
Bottom line,this year's "public" property auction is not very public.
<p>
If you are reading this, you are likely interested in Detroit property ownership and are looking for a last minute solution to making bids in this year's WAYNE COUNTY auction.<p>
Look no further! bidkitty has arrived as a working proof of concept model for making proxy bids and creating dialogue.<p>

<h3>The idea is simple, lets connect, strategize and unite resources, knowledge and interests while increasing the acreage of what we know is possible.</h3>
<hr>
<p>bidkitty can network resources in an ANY auction scenario. She enjoys indexing community bid requests while displaying them in AUCTION END order and
tracking a number of other variables regarding your "BID REQUESTS." bidkitty is a real tool for proxy bidding networks.<p>
Anyone can create a bid request FREELY/anonymously below. It doesn't mean we will win your bid but we will do our best and will transfer the property to you if you choose to purchase it.
The bid request form allows you to share your contact information, your story/plan, several database fields for handling the financials!<p>
If pROXY is utilized (BY YOU!), we will be holding parties on several auction days of the auction to network, celebrate and collect any funds available from bid makers like yourself.

A bid on pROXY can be used to share your interest in ownership or to invite "IN AUCTION" dialogue.
pROXY also makes a great resource for developers who don't want to infringe on land that residents would like to claim for a community purpose.
