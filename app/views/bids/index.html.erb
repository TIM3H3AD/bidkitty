<p>In 2014, Wayne County increased the cost of participation in the annual land auction by 300% (now $2000) despite the fact that many properties went unsold in 2013 with a minimum bid of $500.
After auction players have stacked their chips, those without the buy in ticket funds are left to watch their neighborhood sell off to the highest bidder. Even community efforts to fundraise toward the "multi-bid" ticket have been marginalized by the creation of the $25K property bundles.<p>
Bottom line, this year's "public" property auction isn't very public.

A bid on <i><i>bidkitty</i></i> can be used to share your interest in ownership or to invite "IN AUCTION" dialogue.
<i>bidkitty</i> and our resource parties are a great tool for developers who don't want to infringe on land that residents would like to claim for a community purpose.
<p>
To organize your own bid team, please contact via proxy information below. If you submit your property bid to <i>bidkitty</i>, we will use our funds and ticket to purchase this property on your behalf. The bid request form will ask you for your max bid price.
<p>
<p><i>bidkitty</i> can network resources in an ANY auction scenario. She enjoys indexing community bid requests while displaying them in AUCTION END order and
tracking a number of other variables regarding your "BID REQUESTS." <i>bidkitty</i> is a real tool for proxy bidding networks.<p>
Anyone can create a bid request FREELY/anonymously below. It doesn't mean we will win your bid but we will do our best and will transfer the property to you if you choose to purchase it.
The bid request form allows you to share your contact information, your story/plan, several database fields for handling the financials!<p>
If <i><i>bidkitty</i></i> is utilized (BY YOU!), we will be holding parties on several auction days of the auction to network, celebrate and collect any funds available from bid makers like yourself.
