Many homes in Detroit are neighbored by a number of vacant lots, thus making this a unique opportunity for the people of Detroit to support one another in taking ownership of the city. Coordinated purchasing efforts will only increase the number and value of Detroit assets while strengthening local networks to ensure that Detroit remains owned by intention and not just speculation.
