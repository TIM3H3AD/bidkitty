<p>In 2014, Wayne County increased the cost of participation in the annual land auction by 300% (now $2000) despite the fact that many properties went unsold in 2013 with a minimum bid of $500.
After auction players have stacked their chips, those without the buy in ticket funds are left to watch their neighborhood sell off to the highest bidder. Even community efforts to fundraise toward the "multi-bid" ticket have been marginalized by the creation of the $25K property bundles.<p>
Bottom line,this year's "public" property auction is not very public.
<p>
If you are reading this, you are likely interested in Detroit property ownership and are looking for a last minute solution to making bids in this year's WAYNE COUNTY auction.<p>

A bid on pROXY can be used to share your interest in ownership or to invite "IN AUCTION" dialogue.
pROXY also makes a great resource for developers who don't want to infringe on land that residents would like to claim for a community purpose.
