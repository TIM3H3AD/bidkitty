Turtle Dove's "12% Solution" is a way for neighbors to collectively 
direct investment money meant for acquiring properties in the tax auction.  
Whereas it normally takes a $10,000 deposit to bid on multiple lots in the 
auction, we offer strategic support for individuals and groups who want to 
acquire property but don't have the $10,000.
<p>
We will purchase as many properties on behalf of YOU as funds allow and, 
if they are successfully acquired at the auction, give YOU the right of 
first refusal in negotiating a final sale of those properties.
<p>
In addition to activating vacant properties, we are seeking community 
partners in local housing/anti-foreclosure  to address Detroit’s tax 
foreclosure crisis for occupied properties. If a family’s home is under 
tax foreclosure, Turtle Dove would attempt to buy their property in the 
tax auction to sell and/or finance it back to the family, keeping them in 
their home and preserving the neighborhood.
<p>
TURTLEDOVE is a way for neighbors to activate property in their area, 
help keep families who are under tax foreclosure in their homes and is 
ultimately an investment in the land, people and city of Detroit.
