<p> 
Many homes in Detroit are neighbored by a number of vacant lots, thus making this a unique opportunity for the people of Detroit to support one another in taking ownership of the city. Coordinated purchsing efforts will only increase the number and value of Detroit assets while strengthening local networks to ensure that Detroit remains owned by intention and not just speculation.

<p>
Have you paid your taxes?<p>
You need to have your taxes paid in order to use your house to purchase its sidelots.

bidkitty was inspired by the auction model of property distribution and designed to create a dialogue for data exchange between auction participants in hope of conserving financial resources for expanding community development.<p>
Whether you are trying to buy your own home, the lot next to it or the entire block, bidkitty is here to network community leaders to make property ownership a new form of public work.<p>
If you are next to a property and you cannot afford to purchase it, bidkitty will purchase the property on your behalf if you complete the bid request below.
