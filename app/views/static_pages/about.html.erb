Turtle Dove's "12% Solution" is a way for neighbors to collectively 
direct investment money meant for acquiring properties in the tax auction.  
Whereas it normally takes a $10,000 deposit to bid on multiple lots in the 
auction, we offer strategic support for individuals and groups who want to 
acquire property but don't have the $10,000.
<p>
We will purchase as many properties on behalf of YOU as funds allow and, 
if they are successfully acquired at the auction, give YOU the right of 
first refusal in negotiating a final sale of those properties.
<p>
In addition to activating vacant properties, we are seeking community 
partners in local housing/anti-foreclosure  to address Detroit’s tax 
foreclosure crisis for occupied properties. If a family’s home is under 
tax foreclosure, Turtle Dove would attempt to buy their property in the 
tax auction to sell and/or finance it back to the family, keeping them in 
their home and preserving the neighborhood.
