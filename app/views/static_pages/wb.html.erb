This project is developed with the support of several open sourced tools of the internet. 
It can be funded via <a href="http://bitcoin.org" target="_blank">BITCOIN</a> or a digital asset designed for Detroit called a <a href="http://theohyeah.com/coins/12" target="_blank">SIDELOT</a>. 
SIDELOTs have a fixed rate of issuance and allow anyone to easily transfer project equity and capital through the use of Detroit's digital barter economies.

<h5>INTRODUCTION</h5><br><p>
This proposal is outlined in two phases. PHASE 1 is the proposed purchase of nine adjacent lots to connect lots already owned by FOURSIGHT FARM. PHASE 2 is the proposed leasing of two neighboring city blocks for 5 years to develop several models for sustainable re-development. These lots are immediately adjacent to FOURSIGHT FARM and have been a notorious site for dumping.  
<hr>
<h5>FINANCIAL MODEL</h5><br><p>
The UOI will raise monies through online crowdsourcing and its sustainable public works practices. Excess revenue produced during crowdfunding and ROI periods will be accounted for using digital assets with the intention of creating a "FORECLOSURE HEDGE" to support <a href="https:xotoz.com" target="_blank">BIDKITTY</a> members requesting financial aid. This UOI is requesting the use of two full city blocks with the intent of offering two viable models for redeveloping Detroit one SIDEBLOCK at a time. 60% of the acreage alotted in PHASE 2 is designed to generate property rental revenue. Half of these lots have prospective tennants and the spaces are being reserved through the sale of <a href="http://theohyeah.com/coins/12" target="_blank">SIDELOT</a>s. This model will be tested by one of these tennants this year on a sidelot already owned by FOURSIGHT FARM. The UOI is initially seeking a 5-10 year lease for all PHASE 2 properties.

<h5>PHASE 1</h5>
<p>
Connects adjacent lots on FOURSIGHT FARM and begins building grass and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taro" target="_blank">TARO</a> swales. <i>If the TARO does not prove efficient or effective, it will be replaced with fruit trees and grape vines.</i>  While starting a small herd of goats at 14621 WESTBROOK, we are currently offering all the materials in this proposal at 14609 / 14621 / 14595 WESTBROOK. Our compost piles are fairly young but we are willing and able to begin building piles in the PHASE 2 area. We are receiving a 30'x60' HOOP HOUSE and will be splitting it into 4 plots with at least one aquaponic fishery.

<h5>PHASE 2</h5>
<p>
Move GNFD (material salvage/processing/distribution) from 14621 WESTBROOK to proposed location on the WEST BLOCK with shipping containers as sound barriers, storage and a supervised public dumpster when open. Completing the TARO swale and maintaining compost lanes is the immediate priority.
</p>
<p>The EAST BLOCK is designed to house 4 project managers and their projects on plots running east to west. These modular plots allow tennants to tweak "blue/green" models while giving the city time to evaluate project models, scaleability and location. It is intended that the most viable and prefered of these four farms will expand and permanently call this location home. It is possible that a plot would be leased locallyand the alloted shipping container would become storage or work space. Tennants could and likely will collaborate and combine projects. There would be at least 1 HOOP HOUSE on the EAST BLOCK as currently planned with the potential of several. </p>
<p>Each farm will have at least one shipping container placed as far east as possible to allow larger southern facing gardens. Rainwater will be harvested however drinking water would be supplied  by FOURSIGHT FARM until proper filtration systems are reliable. Electricity will be produced through solar panels and windmills.

<h3>potential distribution hub / solar power supply station</h3>
<img src="/assets/fenkell.jpg"/><br>
<p>This building is ideal for distributing offerings like firewood and food to the greater community. It has a large and sloped southward facing roof with ample land for additional parking, storage or solar array. <strong><i>This building is also a bit of an eyesore and this proposal is ultimately not attached to this structure or location!</i></strong></p>

<h3>potential housing in community</h3> 
<img src="/assets/house.jpg"/>
<p>This house and its adjacent lots are similar to our PHASE 2 models and we would like to make this home available to a permanent tennant. This building's neighbor is a steadfast member of the community. Her sister lives on the next block over and a mutual friend of theirs would like to take ownership of the building. We already placed a request NOT TO DEMOLISH this building and are prepared to bid if it goes to auction.
