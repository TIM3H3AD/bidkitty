-soil remediation through permaculture<br> 
-increase local food supply<br>
-create an environment for community events in open fields<br>

<h5>PHASE 2</h5>
<p>
Move GNFD (material salvage) from 14621 WESTBROOK to proposed location with shipping containers as sound barriers and storage. Complete TARO swale and contine building compost lanes.
</p>
<h3>material salvage / swale / residential plots (b,c,d,e)</h3>
<img src="/assets/modular.jpg"/><br>
<p>Finger farms running east to west start with a shipping container angled slightly toward sunset. These modular plots allow tennants to tweak "blue/green" models while giving the city time to consider permanent options. Each farm will have at least one shipping container placed as far east as possible to allow larger southern facing gardens. Rainwater would be harvested, however drinking water would be delivered until properly filtered. Electricity could be supplied by DTE or produced through wind, solar or compost processing.

<h3>potential distribution building</h3>
<img src="/assets/fenkell.jpg"/><br>
<p>This building is ideal for distributing offerings like firewood to the greater community. It would be rehabilitated in the spirit of a produce stand.</p>
